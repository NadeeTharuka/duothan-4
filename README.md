Display accurate arrival times and updates for all transport services.

### Integrated Payment System
Allow users to manage and top-up their transport passes.
Facilitate contactless payments for all transport services through the digital pass.

### Traffic Optimization and Management
Implement algorithms to analyze traffic patterns and optimize signal timings.
Provide alternative routes during congestion to improve traffic flow.

### User-Friendly Web Interface
- Develop an intuitive web interface for users to manage their transport passes.
- View transport options, make payments, track journey history, and more.
